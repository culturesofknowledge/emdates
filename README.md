## EM Dates

EM Dates is an early modern calendar conversion service for the sixteenth- to eighteenth-century under development by the [Cultures of Knowledge][1] project at Oxford University. It is the second of what will eventually become [three Linked Open Data resources][2] also comprising [EM Places][1] and EM People built on a [shared humanities infrastructure platform][3] in collaboration with the [Huygens Institute][4] (KNAW) in Amsterdam.
